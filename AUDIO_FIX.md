# 🔧 Fixing One-Way Audio Issue

## ❌ Problem: One Person Can Talk, Other Can Only Listen

This happens when **both users don't have microphone access properly configured**.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION - Step by Step:

### For BOTH Users (Very Important!):

#### Step 1: Check Microphone Permissions

**On the login screen, when you enter your name:**
- Click "Continue"
- Browser will ask: **"Allow microphone access?"**
- **YOU MUST CLICK "ALLOW"** ✅

If you clicked "Block" by mistake:
1. Look for a camera/microphone icon in the address bar (top left)
2. Click it
3. Change to "Allow"
4. **Refresh the page (F5)**
5. Enter your name again

---

#### Step 2: Test Your Microphone

**Before joining a room:**
1. Open browser console: Press `F12`
2. Look for this message: `"Microphone access granted"`
3. If you see errors, microphone is NOT working!

---

#### Step 3: Join the Room Correctly

**BOTH users must:**
1. ✅ Allow microphone access FIRST
2. ✅ Then join the same room ID
3. ✅ Wait a few seconds for connection

---

## 🔍 Debugging Steps:

### Check Console (F12) for Both Users:

**Good Signs (✅):**
```
Microphone access granted
Local audio tracks: [object]
Adding audio track to peer...
✅ Received remote track from: [username]
```

**Bad Signs (❌):**
```
❌ No local stream available!
Error accessing microphone
Permission denied
```

## 🎯 Common Issues & Fixes:

### Issue 1: "Only I can hear my friend, they can't hear me"
**Fix:** 
- You didn't allow microphone access
- Refresh page and click "Allow" when asked

### Issue 2: "My friend can hear me, but I can't hear them"
**Fix:**
- Your friend didn't allow microphone access
- They need to refresh and allow microphone

### Issue 3: "Neither of us can hear each other"
**Fix:**
- Both of you didn't allow microphone
- Both refresh and allow microphone
- Both join the same room again

### Issue 4: "I allowed microphone but still not working"
**Fix:**
1. Close the browser tab completely
2. Reopen the URL
3. Enter your name
4. Allow microphone again
5. Join room

## 🧪 Quick Test:

### Test if your microphone is working:

1. **Open browser console (F12)**
2. **Paste this code:**
```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
  .then(stream => {
    console.log('✅ Microphone working!');
    stream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
      console.log('Track:', track.kind, 'Enabled:', track.enabled);
      track.stop();
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('❌ Microphone NOT working:', error);
  });
```

3. **If you see "✅ Microphone working!" - you're good!**
4. **If you see "❌ Microphone NOT working" - fix permissions**

## 📋 Checklist for BOTH Users:

Before complaining about audio:

- [ ] Did you click "Allow" for microphone?
- [ ] Do you see "Microphone access granted" in console?
- [ ] Did you wait 5-10 seconds after joining?
- [ ] Are you both in the EXACT same room ID?
- [ ] Did you check if you're muted (red microphone icon)?
- [ ] Is your system microphone working (test in other apps)?

## ✅ How It Should Work:

When everything is working correctly:

   - Allows microphone ✅
   - Both users see each other in participants

3. **Both can talk** 🎤
   - Both can hear 🔊
   - Both see speaking indicators when someone talks
   - Both can mute/unmute

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

Open console (F12) on BOTH sides and share:
1. Screenshot of console messages
2. Any red error messages
3. Whether you see "Microphone access granted"
