# üîì Bypassing Localtunnel Password / Using Ngrok

## Option 1: Bypass Localtunnel Password (Easiest)

When you see the tunnel password page, just:
1. **Look for the IP address** shown on the page
2. **Click "Click here to continue"** button
3. Done! The page will load normally

**OR** you can use this command to get the bypass URL:
```bash
# The tunnel password page shows your IP
# Just click "Continue" or note your IP for future access
```

## ‚ö° Quick Fix Right Now

**For Localtunnel (Current Setup):**

The password page is just a security feature. To bypass:

1. **Visit the URL:** `https://chilly-geckos-wear.loca.lt`
2. **You'll see a page saying "Enter tunnel password"**
3. **Look for a link that says "Click to Continue" or just close the page and reopen**
4. **Share the URL with friends** - they'll see the same page, just click continue

The tunnel is working! The password page is just an info screen.

## üéØ Best Solution for You

Since you want something that "just works", I recommend:

### Use Cloudflared (No password, no signup):

# Run every time
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

This gives you a clean URL with NO password prompt!
